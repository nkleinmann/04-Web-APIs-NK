Fourth homework for UNH coding Bootcamp: Coding Quiz.  I built the quiz from scratch and used a script.js file.  The quiz is timed (30 seconds) and subtracts 10 seconds for every incorrect answer.  There are currently 5 problems about JavaScript.  Be careful, when the timer runs out, the quiz is over!

Parts of Website:

1. User is presented with start screen for Coding Quiz
2. When start button clicked, timer starts and user is presented with question
3. When user selects answer, user is presented with incorrect or correct
4. Time is subtracted from the clock when answer is incorrect
5. When all questions are answered or timer reaches 0, quiz ends
6. When the game is over, user can same initials and score

Challenges: This was very difficult as well as fun to build.  This is the first project that I worked with jQuery and local storage.  One of the most difficult parts for me was creating how to show a high score list at the end of the quiz using local storage.  Another challenging part, was trying to figure out the logic for how to loop through the series of questions (hint: I ended up using questionIndex).
